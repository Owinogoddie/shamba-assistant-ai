Climate: Coffee thrives in tropical and subtropical climates.\n\n2. Temperature: Optimal range is between 60°F to 70°F (15°C to 21°C). Coffee plants are sensitive to frost and extreme heat.\n\n3. Altitude: Arabica coffee grows best at altitudes between 3,000 to 6,000 feet (900 to 1,800 meters) above sea level.\n\n4. Rainfall: Coffee requires about 60 to 80 inches (1,500 to 2,000 mm) of rainfall per year, ideally with a short dry season.\n\n5. Soil: Well-draining, slightly acidic soil with a pH between 6.0 to 6.5 is ideal. Rich in organic matter is preferable.\n\n6. Shade: Partial shade, especially in lower altitudes, can improve coffee quality and protect plants from extreme temperatures.\n\n7. Humidity: Moderate to high humidity is beneficial for coffee plants.\n\n8. Wind protection: Coffee plants prefer areas protected from strong winds.\n\nThese conditions allow coffee plants to develop properly, produce high-quality beans, and achieve optimal flavor profiles. It's important to note that slight variations in these conditions can significantly affect the taste and quality of the coffee produced."
